# Stylized Personal Website

[This website](https://davidjosephind.github.io/CSS-MySite/) is a result of what I've been learning throughout the [Web Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) I've been taking.

I am currently learning Bootstrap.

I have got lot more to learn as part of this course, the next of which is Javascript and the Document Object Model(DOM).
