# Stylized Personal Website

[This website](https://davidjosephind.github.io/Stylized-Personal-Website/) is a result of what I've been learning throughout the [Web Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) I've been taking. This project was a part of the CSS modules in the course.

The goal of this project was to understand and learn to use CSS to create websites that look great.

### The things I learnt to use during the course of this project were:

- Inline, Internal and External CSS
- Debugging CSS code
- Anatomy of CSS syntax
- Selectors in CSS
- Classes and ID's in CSS
- Pseudo classes in CSS
- Adding Favicons to websites
- Divs in HTML
- The Box model of website styling
- Manipulating the CSS display property
- Static, Relative and Absolute positioning in CSS
- Aligning elements in CSS
- Font styling in websites
- CSS float and clear

Some snaps of the website are below.
